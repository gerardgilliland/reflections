How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
I used Notepad++ > Plugins > Compare and it was easy.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Mainly, I could quit wasting time making backups of full files and trying to name them meaningfully.
It could keep me from making previous mistakes again.

I am stopping as Lesson 1 concept 11

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pro - you can commit for each feature change / add
Con -- can't think of any.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because they are tied together.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
diff --git fileA fileB
log 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
right now I don't think I need to find out how to back out of changes

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Use the correct process to make changes on my github site.


this eventualy works:
alias npp="/c/Program\ Files\ \(x86\)/Notepad++/notepad++.exe"

this works:
start notepad++ 
start notepad++ <filename>
alias npp='start notepad++'
npp <filename>

I suspect you could do the same with Sublime

I would have liked to see a picture with 
MyMessyFolder box
arrow with add label pointing to CommittFolder box
arrow with committ label pointing to GitHub box
Maybe I don't have this right but that's because I haven't seen it yet.
